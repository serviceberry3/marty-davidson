# An auto-reply bot for iMessage (Mac) and Android Messages #

This is Marty, an iMessage auto-reply robot which can store and retrieve usersâ€™ information in an SQL databse, call users and deliver automated robotic messages, schedule appointments, and remotely control an LED display.

There are three versions of Marty currently available:
* For older versions (pre-High Sierra) of MacOS. Probably won't work further back than OS X Mountain Lion. This version is implemented in AppleScript or JavaScript for Automation (JXA). Located in **Marty_AppleScript** and **Marty_JavaScript** folders. 
    * To use it, change any AppleScript files to .scpt and then select them as the "AppleScript Handler" in Messages > Preferences > General on a Mac Laptop. 
* For newer verisons (High Sierra or more recent) of MacOS. This version is implemented in Swift and interacts with chat.db via SQL.
* For Android. This version is an Android app that uses Android's BroadCastReceiver and android.provider.Telephony.SMS_RECEIVED.
