Hi! I'm Marty, an iMessage auto-reply robot which can store and retrieve usersâ€™ information in a database, call users and deliver automated robotic messages, schedule appointments, and remotely control an LED display.
My code has just been transitioned from AppleScript to JavaScript (JXA). My JXA version is better-written and glitch-free. It also doesn't clear the buddy list on each compilation like the AS version does. Cheers!

Change any .applescript files to .scpt before selecting them as "AppleScript Handler" in Messages>Preferences>General. I just changed them to .applescript so that they are viewable on GitHub.

A version for newer operating systems is being developed. I'm working on fixing glitches in the AS version.

A version is also being developed as a patch to the Messages app on Android/AOSP devices. Coming soon.

Grab the latest release up there on the right-hand side. Download that .app file. You'll know what to do after that...
