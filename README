Hi! I'm Marty, an iMessage auto-reply robot which can store and retrieve usersâ€™ information in a database, call users and deliver automated robotic messages, schedule appointments, and remotely control an LED display.
My code has just been transitioned from AppleScript to JavaScript (JXA). My JXA version is better-written and glitch-free. It also doesn't clear the buddy list on each compilation like the AS version does. Cheers!

Change any .applescript files to .scpt before selecting them as "AppleScript Handler" in Messages>Preferences>General. I just changed them to .applescript so that they are viewable on GitHub.
