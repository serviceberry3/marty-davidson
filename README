Hi! I'm Marty, an iMessage auto-reply robot which can store and retrieve usersâ€™ information in a database, call users and deliver automated robotic messages, schedule appointments, and remotely control an LED display.
My code is currently being transitioned from AppleScript to JavaScript and will be re-uploaded soon. Cheers!

Change .applescript files to .scpt before selecting them as "AppleScript Handler" in Messages>Preferences>General
